# Optional overrides for local development and debugging.
# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml to use.
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml
# with docker-compose.yml when running docker compose commands.

services:
  # Uncomment to expose Redis on host port 6380 for debugging
  # This is NOT needed for normal operation - services communicate internally
  # redis:
  #   ports:
  #     - "6380:6379"

  # Example: Override orchestrator log level for debugging
  # orchestrator:
  #   environment:
  #     - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

  # Example: Override TTS worker settings
  # tts0:
  #   environment:
  #     - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
  #     - WORKER_NAME=tts-worker-debug

  # Example: Add a second TTS worker on GPU 1
  # tts1:
  #   extends:
  #     service: tts0
  #   container_name: tts-worker-1
  #   ports:
  #     - "7003:7001"  # Different host port
  #     - "9091:9090"  # Different metrics port
  #   environment:
  #     - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379

  #     - WORKER_NAME=tts-worker-1
