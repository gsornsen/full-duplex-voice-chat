## Quick Summary

This project implements a realtime duplex voice chat system with low-latency TTS streaming and barge-in support. **Milestones M0-M10 are complete**, establishing the core infrastructure: gRPC streaming protocol, mock TTS worker, dual transport architecture (LiveKit WebRTC primary + WebSocket fallback), real-time barge-in with Voice Activity Detection, complete Model Manager lifecycle with TTL/LRU eviction, and two real TTS adapters (Piper CPU baseline, CosyVoice 2 GPU). The implementation has **exceeded M2 scope** by delivering production-ready LiveKit WebRTC as the primary transport. **M6 is complete**, implementing the CosyVoice 2 GPU TTS adapter with Docker isolation, shared audio utilities, comprehensive testing (51 tests), and production deployment guide. **Parallel TTS synthesis** is production-ready, delivering **2x throughput improvement** with persistent worker pools. Additional GPU TTS adapters (XTTS, Sesame) and advanced features (dynamic routing) are planned for M7-M13.

## Known Limitations

### Platform Constraints

**WSL2 Environment**:
- gRPC tests require `--forked` mode due to upstream segfault issue
- Workaround: Use `just test-integration` (automatic)
- Alternative: Skip gRPC tests in WSL2, run in Docker/native Linux
- Documentation: [GRPC_SEGFAULT_WORKAROUND.md](archive/working/GRPC_SEGFAULT_WORKAROUND.md)
- Status: Fully mitigated, tests 100% reliable

**Python 3.13**:
- Performance tests deferred due to instability in some libraries
- Unit and integration tests fully functional
- Recommendation: Use Python 3.12 if 3.13 causes issues

### Implementation Gaps

**Limited TTS Adapter Selection**:
- Piper CPU adapter implemented (M5 complete)
- CosyVoice 2 GPU adapter implemented (M6 complete)
- GPU adapters (XTTS, Sesame) are M7-M8 milestones
- Justfile commands for GPU adapters exist but not functional yet
- Mock adapter still available for testing (440Hz sine wave)

**Static Routing Only**:
- M2 uses static worker address configuration
- Dynamic capability-based routing is M9 milestone
- Single worker only in current setup (unless manual multi-GPU)
