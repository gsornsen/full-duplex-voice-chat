"""Worker selection and routing logic.

This module provides worker selection for TTS synthesis requests.

M2 scope: Static routing to single configured worker.
M9 scope: Dynamic routing with capability matching, load balancing, and session affinity.

M9 Enhancements:
- Capability-based routing (match model requirements to worker capabilities)
- Load balancing (distribute across least-busy workers)
- Session affinity (same session â†’ same worker for voice consistency)
- Graceful fallback (handle worker failures)
- Health-based filtering (exclude unhealthy workers)
- Metrics integration (track routing decisions)

Performance targets:
- Routing decision overhead: <1ms (p95)
- Session affinity hit rate: >95%
- Load distribution variance: <10%
