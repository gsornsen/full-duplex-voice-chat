"""Worker selection algorithms for load balancing.

This module implements various worker selection strategies for M9 Routing v1:
- Round-robin: Simple fair distribution
- Least-loaded: Select worker with lowest queue depth
- Least-latency: Select worker with lowest synthesis latency
- Random: Random selection (for testing)

Performance targets:
- Selection overhead: <100Î¼s (p95)
- Thread-safe for concurrent requests
- Stateless algorithms (except round-robin counter)

Example usage:
    >>> selector = WorkerSelector()
    >>> worker = selector.least_loaded(workers)
    >>> print(f"Selected: {worker.name} (queue: {worker.metrics['queue_depth']})")
