"""WhisperX STT plugin for LiveKit Agents.

This module provides a LiveKit Agents-compatible STT plugin that wraps our
custom WhisperX adapter. It bridges the LiveKit Agents STT protocol with our
optimized WhisperX implementation.

Features:
- Non-streaming STT (requires VAD wrapper for streaming)
- 4-8x faster than standard Whisper
- CPU and GPU support with auto-selection
- Multiple model sizes (tiny/base/small/medium/large)
- Automatic audio resampling to 16kHz
- Singleton model caching (reduces memory usage for multiple instances)
- Cross-process locking (prevents GPU contention in multiprocess workers)

    """WhisperX STT plugin for LiveKit Agents.

    Wraps our custom WhisperX adapter to provide LiveKit Agents STT interface.
    This is a non-streaming STT, so it must be wrapped with VAD for real-time use.

    Singleton Caching:
        Multiple STT instances with the same configuration (model_size, device,
        compute_type) will share a single underlying WhisperX model, reducing
        memory usage. Models remain cached in memory even after individual STT
        instances are closed.

        model_size: Whisper model size ("tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large")
        device: Device for inference ("cpu", "cuda", or "auto" for auto-detection)
        compute_type: Compute precision ("int8", "float16", "float32", or "default")
        language: Default language code (e.g., "en") or None for auto-detection

    Example:
        ```python
        from src.plugins.whisperx import STT

        # Create STT instance
        stt_plugin = STT(
            model_size="small",

        Performance Optimization:
