* [x] Add Redis service registration/discovery skeleton.

### 🧪 Validation

* [x] WS echo test: text→worker→audio→back.
* [x] WebRTC echo works locally.
* [x] Redis keys reflect worker registration.

**Completion Evidence**:
- LiveKit WebRTC transport fully operational (PRIMARY)
- WebSocket transport functional (SECONDARY/CLI)
- 5-service Docker compose stack (Redis, LiveKit, Caddy, Orch, TTS)
- Session management with state machine
- Integration tests: 6/8 full pipeline tests passing

**Architecture Delivered**:
- `src/orchestrator/livekit_utils/`: LiveKit agent + transport
- `src/orchestrator/transport/`: WebSocket transport
- `src/orchestrator/session.py`: State machine (IDLE→LISTENING→SPEAKING→BARGED_IN)
- `src/orchestrator/registry.py`: Redis worker discovery
- Caddy reverse proxy for HTTPS WebRTC
- TLS certificate infrastructure

**Enhancement Details**:
- Original plan: WS primary, LiveKit as agent framework
- Actual delivery: LiveKit WebRTC primary with full production infrastructure
- Result: More robust foundation for scale-out
